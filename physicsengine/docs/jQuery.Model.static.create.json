By implementing \ncreate along with the rest of the [jquery.model.services service api], your models provide an abstract\nAPI for services.  </p>\n\n<p>Create is called by save to create a new instance.  If you want to be able to call save on an instance\nyou have to implement create.</p>\n\n<p>The easist way to implement create is to just give it the url to post data to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.Model(\"Recipe\",{\n  create: \"/recipes\"\n},{})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This lets you create a recipe like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>new Recipe({name: \"hot dog\"}).save(function(){\n  this.name //this is the new recipe\n}).save(callback)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>You can also implement create by yourself.  You just need to call success back with\nan object that contains the id of the new instance and any other properties that should be\nset on the instance.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the following code makes a request \nto '/recipes.json?name=hot+dog' and gets back\nsomething that looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{ \n  id: 5,\n  createdAt: 2234234329\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The code looks like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$.Model(\"Recipe\", {\n  create : function(attrs, success, error){\n    $.post(\"/recipes.json\",attrs, success,\"json\");\n  }\n},{})\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>API</h2>", "children": []})
